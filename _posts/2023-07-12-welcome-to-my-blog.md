Welcome to my personal blog. This site will contain editorials about my personal projects or any interesting side activity that I do. Currently, I'm interested in learning a bit of system programming so I can see for myself how things actually get executed under the hood. And on the side, I use C++ and Python for doing some physics/math simulations. 

Apart from coding I like running, cycling, and swimming a lot. I'm also a certified open-water scuba diver, which is like the most basic certification you can get.

This site is based on Jekyll because it was the easiest way to set up a static site in the shortest amount of time. Also, it integrates extremely well with GitHub pages making it extremely easy to host. And adding new blog pages is just adding a file to my post directory and committing that change. So overall a very easy-to-use setup for someone who doesn't know much about web development. Or anyone who doesn't want to bother much about setting up a whole tech stack to host a blog.
